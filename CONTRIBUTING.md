### Guideline

- No one allowed to put code outside `src` directory.
- `pages` directory dedicated only for routing(redirecting from `App.jsx`).
- When jsx file too big in `pages` directory chunk into smaller components those goes to `components` directory.
- Any chunk code, save in `components` directory.
- `mock` directory only for `.json` file.
- If you want to create your own hook, put in `hooks` directory.
